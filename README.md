#drain

Drain integrates Python machine learning tasks with [drake](https://github.com/Factual/drake), resulting in a robust and efficient machine learning pipeline. Drain additionally provides a library of methods for both the processing data going into the pipeline and exploration of models coming out of the pipeline.

## Example

## ModelData

## metrics

## grid_search

## explore

## Future improvements
